        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Intended for the slow cooker but also great on the stove or in 
            an Instant Pot, this easy chili leverages canned goods to keep 
            prep time to a minimum.

            This recipe serves as a great base to experiment with. Substituting
            the ground beef for another meat of your choice, mixing and matching or
            adding different kinds of beans, adding some vegetables, or throwing in some
            of your favourite hot sauce are just a few of the ways to spice up this
            simple dish.
