        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            A simple stew consisting of the classic staples beans and
            rice, with ground meat for added protein and spices for added
            flavour.
        </p>
        <p>
            This recipe is intended for an Instant Pot, but works fine on
            the stovetop, with added time to reduce. As we are using black beans,
            no soaking time is necessary. Dried beans may be substituted for
            canned. If using canned, add the beans nearer to the end of 
            cooking time. Less water or more reduction time may be needed
            in this case.
        </p>
